The groundbreaking article by Alan Turing investigates the idea of computers thinking and questions the notion of intelligence. His Turing Test concept is a clever method of assessing computer intelligence by looking at behavior rather than internal workings. The thing that most strikes me about Turing is how presciently he addressed frequent criticisms of AI, including the idea that robots are incapable of feeling awareness or creativity. His work, which shows how far ahead of his time he was, is still fundamental to contemporary AI.
